            %h2 Which technologies are supported by the Testributor workers?
            %p
              %strong
                Quick answer:
              We don't mean to sound cheeky, but we support nearly everything!
            %p
              %strong
                Longer answer:
              We built Testributor in a way that a vast range of languages,
              frameworks and dependencies can be supported. The workers that
              will run your test suite "live" inside a Docker container.
              In order to speed things up with creating a suitable
              test environment, a huge number of open-source pre-build Docker
              images exist for you, in order to add what you need in your
              docker-compose.yml file and get everything in play quickly.
            %p
              To make things even easier for you, we have already tested a number
              of technologies ourselves and you can select those via your project
              settings page. Behind the scenes, we add your selections in the
              docker-compose.yml file, as well.

            %h2 What is a docker-compose.yml file?
            %p
              This is a simple text file. Inside this file, you define the
              services, networks and volumes you wish to use in your Docker
              container. The syntax used to write those definitions is YAML
              (which is very easy by the way!). You can find the complete
              reference of what goes in this file
              #{link_to 'here', 'https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/'}.
